# Process Scheduling Simulation

This script simulates process scheduling to compare different scheduling
algorithms based on performance metrics. The results may differ in each
execution due to random process generation.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running the following command:

```
python --version
```

## Download the project

```
git clone https://github.com/IsaquePFerreira/process_scheduling
```

## Navigate to the Script Location

Open a terminal or command prompt and change the directory to where the script is located:

```
cd process_scheduling

```

# Run the Script

Execute the following command:

```
python process_scheduling.py
```

# Troubleshooting

If you get a ModuleNotFoundError, ensure that Python is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.

If the script does not execute, try running:

```
python3 process_scheduling.py
```

(Some systems require python3 instead of python.)
